# GearWars

GearWars is a game created years ago but never made it out of beta, the maps used were subpar and almost randomly picked, badly fitting in with the game itself. And yet for all that, the game is fun and can result in many different playthroughs.

You can see many ways the game could be improved, but it just never got the love it deserved.
