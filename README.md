# GearWars

GearWars is a game created years ago but never made it out of beta, the maps used were subpar and almost randomly picked, badly fitting in with the game itself. And yet for all that, the game is fun and can result in many different playthroughs.

You can see many ways the game could be improved, but it just never got the love it deserved.

# To run it

The game is created for 1.7.10 and the plugins required are included in the dependencies folder.
You need InventoryAPI, Lib's Disguises and ProtocolLib

# To build it

To build the plugin, you need maven.

# Maps

Please be aware that I do not own these maps, they were always meant to be temporary maps.
You must place them in ServerRoot/Maps/GearWars/
